# Y-Sharp-v3
 Y# version 3 with Much more built-in functions and all codes in one place.

 I put my all codes in one place because my next goal is to build this programming language with both c and python. As my Programming Language is specially developing for Robotic engineering and Computer Automation, I want to built more built-in functions for those tasks. so if you know python please contribute to this project.

To see all currently build functions look in the builtinfunctions.txt file

 # Just add new functions by creating new functions like below:

# If your code needs any python library please add those libraries inside the 'Lib' folder


  ```
    def execute_example(self, exec_ctx):
      "Your code here" # make sure the 'execute_ ' word is a must infront of your function name
    execute_is_function.arg_names = [place here accoding to your function]

  ```
# secondly add those for builtin variables

```
BuiltInFunction.function name without the term 'execute_'             = BuiltInFunction("function name")

```

# Lastly add them for SymbolTable as like this:

```
global_symbol_table.set("the function name using for code", BuiltInFunction.function name without the term 'execute_')

```
